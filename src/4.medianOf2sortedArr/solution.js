/**
 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
    There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
    Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 * Example 1:
    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]
    The median is 2.0

 * Example 2:
    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]
    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number}

 * Analysis: Finding the median of 1 array is easy, so merge and sort the 2 arrays then problem solved,
    but it's far slower than O(log (m+n)).
